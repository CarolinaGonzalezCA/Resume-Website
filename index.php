			<p>I'm a full-time student at the University of Southern Mississippi. I' am working on my degree in Computer Science
		     with a minor in Biology and Chemistry.<br> I currently live in Saucier, MS. I'm originally from Moreno Valley, CA.
			I' am single with no kids. I have 2 nieces that I consider my own. I don't have any pets.<br>
			I enjoy writing code. I'm in my final year of school. I' am preparing to put my skills to use and find a career that I' am passionate about. <br>
    
    
      My favorite quote is: <br> 
			If you Fail, never give up because<br>
			F.A.I.L means<br>
			"First attempt in Learning"<br>
			- End is not the end, in fact <br>
			E.N.D means<br>
			"Effort Never Dies"<br>
			- If you get no as an answer,<br>
			Remember N.O means<br>
			"Next Opportunity".<br>
			So lets be positive.<br>
			- Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</p>
